## Introduction to MMU

### What is MMU?
The **Memory Management Unit (MMU)** is a specialized hardware component that acts as an intermediary between the CPU and physical memory. It's responsible for translating virtual addresses generated by programs into physical addresses in RAM.

### Primary Functions
1. **Address Translation**: Convert virtual addresses to physical addresses
2. **Memory Protection**: Enforce access permissions and prevent unauthorized memory access
3. **Memory Allocation Management**: Support for virtual memory larger than physical memory
4. **Process Isolation**: Ensure processes cannot interfere with each other's memory
5. **Cache Management**: Work with TLB to accelerate address translation

### Why MMU is Essential
- **Security**: Prevents malicious programs from accessing sensitive memory
- **Stability**: Isolates processes to prevent crashes from affecting the entire system
- **Efficiency**: Enables efficient memory utilization through virtual memory
- **Portability**: Programs can run without knowing the actual physical memory layout
- **Multitasking**: Allows multiple processes to run simultaneously with isolated memory spaces

## Virtual Memory Fundamentals

### Virtual Address Space
Each process has its own virtual address space, typically organized as:
- **Text Segment**: Contains executable program code
- **Data Segment**: Contains initialized global and static variables
- **BSS Segment**: Contains uninitialized global and static variables
- **Heap**: Dynamic memory allocation area (grows upward)
- **Stack**: Function call stack and local variables (grows downward)
- **Memory-mapped regions**: Shared libraries, memory-mapped files
